                          that are currently in the system on the verge of aging out of the system.

                            Let be honest, the system has probably failed in preparing you for the world, or left you woefully lacking in need skills or knowledge. 
                         We want to help fill that gap by connection you with other former foster children around the country that are successful and can help to give you the resources or knowledge to help make you just as successful
